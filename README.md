## Overview

The Health Records Management System is a digital platform designed to streamline the management of student health records at Alliance High School, Kikuyu.

## Key Features

- **Student Health Profiles:** Each student has a dedicated health profile that stores important medical information, including medical history, allergies, and current medications.
  
- **Medication Tracking:** The system tracks the medication history of each student, showing when a student took medication and the time of day (morning, afternoon, or evening). This feature helps medical staff monitor and manage ongoing treatments more effectively.
  
- **New Student Registration:** Medical staff can easily add new students to the system, ensuring that their health records are up-to-date from the moment they join the school.

- **Record Updates:** Health records can be edited to reflect changes in a student's medical status, treatments, or medications. This ensures that records are always current and accurate.

- **Non-Busherian Students:** The system supports records for non-Busherian students, making it flexible and adaptable to different student groups.
